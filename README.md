## Introduction

This project is a take on the Kaggle [Titanic -Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) competition.

The data consists of a train.csv and a test.csv pair of files.
train.csv contains the information of some of the passengers on board the Titanic, and their survival status.
test.csv contains similar information, but does not contain the survival status of it's set of passengers.

We're going to train a Neural Network to predict the final status of passengers.
